## 🍺 The Purpose: Free Beer 

[Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman), the creator of the GNU/Linux movement & early proponent of Open Source Software made the distinction that Open Source meant "free" as in free speech, not free beer.

We believe there is room for both. Especially now with the advent of Artificial Intelligence.

> Our vision is a digital world where artificial intelligence, software & access to information is free use and free of cost - a democratization of individual success.

We are on a mission to snuff out the companies & bad actors looking to monetize AI at the expense of the consumer and the industry they operate in.

We believe that by making all the tools free, there will be no room for capitalism to exploit the arts or capitalize on easy arbitraging of AI - when it is meant to be for everyone.

We need developers like you to help us build these tools!

We are committed to continuing to bring new models, weights, a cutting edge AI to you - but we don't have the bandwidth to turn them all into consumer facing apps - unless we work together 💪

It's time us developers & internet marketers worked together to restore some order back to the internet.

Be a part of something great, and watch your creations bring good to the world.

We need your help, if you're willing to lend it.

**& free beer, for all! 🍻.**

> _The ironically beautiful thing about AI is that unlike us humans, it isn’t inherently motivated or influenced by self-interest._
> 
> _It only knows what it has been trained on._ 
> _What it was instructed to learn._ 
> _What we give it._ 
> 
> _If we train it with self-interest, malice, greed or even indifference - that will be the seed with which it evolves from. An almost inevitable beginning of the end of humanity._ 
> 
> _But, if we teach it to know unbounded virtue & benevolence – we may finally see a glimpse of the true potential of the Godliness in humanity, as we watch AI accelerate solutions to the problems we face as a species._ 
> 
> _To give us answers to the issues we have not been able to collectively solve ourself._ 
> 
> _And to ultimately find a way to co-exist sustainably, unite our divided planet, and ultimately bring peace to our world - once and for all._
