## 📯 SERP AI: The Purpose

### Free Beer

[Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman), the creator of the GNU/Linux movement & early proponent of Open Source Software made the distinction that Open Source meant "free" as in free speech, not free beer.

We believe there is room for both. Especially now with the advent of Artificial Intelligence.

> Our vision is a digital world where artificial intelligence, software & access to information is free use and free of cost - a democratization of individual success.

We are on a mission to snuff out the companies & bad actors looking to monetize AI at the expense of the consumer and the industry they operate in.

We believe that by making all the tools free, there will be no room for capitalism to exploit the arts or capitalize on easy arbitraging of AI - when it is meant to be for everyone.

We need developers to help us build these tools, and in exchange are willing to provide resources to help you in turn.

Resources like free compute on GPUs, infrastructure and overhead.

And access to a team that can take your ideas, bring other developers in to help with the parts you don't enjoy, and marketing firepower to bring it to large amounts of users.

It's time use developers & internet marketers worked together to restore some order back to the internet.

Be a part of something great, and watch your creations bring good to the world.

We need your help, if you're willing to lend it.

**& free beer, for all! 🍻.**
